    program main
        implicit none ! Turns off Fortran's weak typing characteristic
        integer :: i
        integer :: enter
        character(len = 20) :: finish ! Similar to a string that can be at most 20 characters
        i = 0
        ! While loop that asks for a number and multiplies it by the index
        do while ( (finish /= "done") .and. (i /= 100) ) ! /= is the syntax for not equal to
            print *, "Index: ", i
            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') " Provide a number: " ! Prints the statement without going into the next line
            read(*, *) enter ! Reads for an integer user-input that's put into the enter variable
            print *, "Your number times the index: ", i * enter
            write(*, '(a)', advance='no') " Type 'done' to end program: "
            read(*,*) finish ! Reads for a character user-input to put into the finish variable. 
            !If finish equals to "done", the while loop will end after this iteration. Continues otherwise until i = 100
            write(*,*) ! Prints a new line
            i = i + 1
        end do
        ! if statement that provides a concluding response to this program
        if (finish == "done") then
            write(*,*) "You have quit the program after index: ", i - 1
        else if (i > 99) then ! If you went through the while loop 100 times, it quits for you. Then tells you the statement below
            write(*,*) " You've used this program enough..."
